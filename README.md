# Fake-Profile-Detection

A model to detect fake user profiles using only the visible data as mentioned.
This is a project where training models

We have trained them in SVM, RandomForest and a 3-layered ANN which gave an accurary of 93%-98% on the test set.

# REQUIREMENTS:

# CONCLUSION:
      
        Among all other classifier methods the RandomForest classifier method gives greater accuracy.
